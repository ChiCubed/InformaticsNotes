# General notes
- Complexities of algorithms, when presented with two arguments, are given in the following format: $$O(a,b)$$, where $$a$$ is the time complexity and $$b$$ the space complexity. (Please see the Mathematics chapter for an explanation of Big-O notation.)
- Complexities refer to the complexity of the solution given here, not necessarily the best possible complexity of any algorithm found to date.
- $$log$$ is $$log_2$$ unless otherwise noted.
