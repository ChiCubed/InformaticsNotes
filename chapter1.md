# General notes
- Complexities of algorithms, when presented with two arguments, are given in the following format: $$O(a,b)$$, where a is the time complexity and b the space complexity. (Please see the Mathematics chapter for an explanation of Big-O notation.)
- Complexities refer to the complexity of the solution given here, not necessarily the best possible complexity of any algorithm found to date.
- $$log$$ is $$log_2$$ unless otherwise noted.
- In some problems where the order of input is not important, it is a good idea to randomise the input. If your solution is timing out but only slightly on some of the larger test cases, it is a good idea to try randomising the input. The function `random_shuffle` (defined in header `<algorithm>`) can shuffle an input array `arr` as follows: `random_shuffle(arr, arr+arr_length);`.
