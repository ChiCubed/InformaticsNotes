# InformaticsNotes

Notes for computer-based informatics, particularly for use in a competition setting

The notes are written in Markdown format for two main reasons:

1. They are easy to write;
2. They can be rendered in multiple formats relatively easily.

## Rendering

The notes can be rendered by executing the command `sh renderpdf.sh` in a terminal.  
At present this script only works on macOS and Linux.  
Please note that [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) is a dependency; the script will link to the install page if you do not have it installed.
